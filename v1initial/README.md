# v2 initial
## Comments
These are initial files for the machine, barely usuable.
- The old x carriage had issues gripping onto the linear bearings and flexed under belt tension. The new x carriage clamps on the bearings and is not missing so much material.
- The new hot end mount grips onto the E3D V6 cooling fins using a zip tie for added stability.
- The new y carriages clamp onto the x linear rods, adding stability.
- The y rod/roller mounts are now more reliable to align with the frame.
- Some distances have been changed, with some yet to change
